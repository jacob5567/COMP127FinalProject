To learn Vue, I simply went to Vue's website (found at <https://vuejs.org/>). Specifically, I went to their "guide" page, found [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/). I found the [introduction page](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) partictularly helpful. For more specific info, I used the "[Vue Instance](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html)" page, the "[List Rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html)" page, and the "[Form Input Bindings](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html)" page.

Vue is particularly useful for making content that dynamically updates with user input, or some other form of input. It is great for projects where everything is on one page. It makes interactions between JavaScript and the DOM seamless and easy. Similar technologies include [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), and other JavaScript frameworks.

For me, Vue was easy to learn and easy to implement. I hardly had any trouble understanding it, and once I got over the initial learning curve, it was seamless to implement. I definitely got a lot more JS framework experience by learning Vue. I would definitely use it again for any JavaScript project I would have in the future.

**There is no need to install anything extra in order to test this project.** I have included the Production Version of Vue with the rest of my project. Simply open *index.html*, and you are good to go. If for some reason you do need to install Vue, it can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/js/vue.min.js). Different installation methods can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html). If, for some reason, nothing works, you can also visit this project online at <https://gallant-mahavira-59e315.netlify.com/>.

This project uses the free font *Megalopolis Extra*, which can be found [here](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/MEgalopolis-Extra).
